# Serapeum

Open source storage, collaboration, and AI tools for human data.

## Deploy your own

Serapeum is fully open source and can be self-hosted for maximum
control over your data. We are built on top of Supabase so you can easily spin up your own backend.

You can either:

1. Host your own instance of the Next.js web app to connect to your own backend project.
2. (Coming soon!) Use the official [Serapeum](serapeum.vercel.app) web UI and connect to your backend instance.

### Run a local server

You can run the app and Supabase on your local machine if you don't want to setup hosting (Supabase docs)[https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development].

Warning: this application is not yet designed to guarentee data persistance across restarts when running locally.
