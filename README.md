# Serapeum

Open source storage, collaboration, and AI tools for human data.

## Deploy your own

Serapeum is fully open source and can be self-hosted for maximum
control over your data. We are built on top of Supabase so you can easily spin up your own backend.

You can either:

1. Host your own instance of the Next.js web app to connect to your own backend project.
2. Use the official [Serapeum](serapeum.vercel.app) web UI and connect to your backend instance.

## Feedback and issues

Please file feedback and issues over on the [Sepapeum GitHub repo](https://github.com/LclyMe/serapeum/issues/new).
